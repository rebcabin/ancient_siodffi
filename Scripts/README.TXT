DCOM.scm is the scheme-based support for siod.  The Cpp-based
support is in ..\dcom\dcom.cpp.  

TESTDCOM.scm is something you should customize for your machine.  It
loads ComTest1, ComTest2, Bug636, YAS, and other objects that only 
exist in my environment.

PP.scm is a really simple pretty printer.  It's useful for 
dumping out huge lists like those representing type libraries.

SIOD.scm contains utilities.

TEST.scm is scaffolding for a future generic testing facility.
