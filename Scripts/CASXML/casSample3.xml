    The following demonstrates embedded XML that refers to a class
    explicitly.  This XML appears at file scope in a file that belongs
    to FileUtilComponent, and the tools project knows this.  Its only
    difference from the sample above is that it does not have the
    targetModule and targetComponent attributes, since these are known
    to the tools.  Note also that some textual convention must
    separate this text from the source.  For Java and C++, we
    recommend '/*% XML' to delimit the beginning of embedded XML and
    '%*/' to delimit the end.  This recommendation is by analogy to
    IIS' ASP pages, which delimit server scripts with embedded '<%'
    and '%>'.
