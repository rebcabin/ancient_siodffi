    The following demonstrates embedded XML that refers to a method
    implicitly.  This XML appears at CLASS scope immediately preceding
    the definition of, say, "Read" in class "FileUtilities2" in a file
    that belongs to FileUtilComponent. Note that the permission tag
    now fits on a single line.
