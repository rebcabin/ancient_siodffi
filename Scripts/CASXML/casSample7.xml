    C O M M E N T :

    The following would appear in a component, specified explicitly,
    that needs to stop a stack walk because it is a generic utility
    component meant to be called by relatively untrusted code.  The
    reason the component is specified explicitly is that the target
    would be ambiguous otherwise.  Its incorrect, implicit
    interpretation would be to target the immediately following class
    or interface definition.
